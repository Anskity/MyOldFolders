The philosofy in bending the elements - An avatar documentary

- Introduction
  Oh, boy... Avatar is INCREDIBLE.
  It has a good story, funny moments, sad moments, good characters and a lot more.
  It's for sure one of the best shows I've ever watched.

  But there's a thing people seem to forget about,
  and I don't blame them because I also didn't pay much attention on it.
  I'm talking about the BENDING.
  I think you'll probably say:
  - Oh, I really like this, the creators of the show even hired marcial artists to animate the bendings better.
  I mean, I really like how bending has an incredible coreography, is super cool to watch and etc.
  But I think people forget about a crucial thing about bending: It's part of the IDENTIDY of the benders.

  Each element has a different way of working.

  There's air, the element of freedom,
  that is about thinking before acting, and just being pacifist in general.
  
  There's water, the element of change,
  that just follows the vibes and adapts to anything.

  There's earth, the element of substance,
  rigid and solid, being brute and just jumping into what you think is right.

  And there's fire, the element of power,
  it's about using your energy and the energy of the sun to achive what you want

  
  In this video I'll try to explain everything I know about bending,
  specially about the culture and philosofy of the elements.
  So, let's go straight into it.
